# This is an auto-generated input file for gas network simulaion
# Pipe lengths must be increments of 10 km, npts number of gridpoints per 1 km of pipe
# Initial data is read from files data_%03d.txt
# where the files data_000.txt-data_007.txt must be present in 
# the directory in which code is executed

# Numeration of pipes goes according incidence.txt:
# take first column, first nonzero entry in the first column
# is pipe 1, the second nonzero entry in the first column is pipe 2 and so on.
#
# All entries must be in SI units, except pipe lengths which must be given in km.

# nodes are numerated by the rows of matrix.cfg
# e.g. first row corresponds to node 1 and etc
