Machine Learning For Gas Network.

(a) As a simple problem we choose deterministically periodic 
functions $d_j(t)$ for $j = 1,\ldots,N$ for every gas draw node 
of the gas network. 
(ML Goal) Train the AI to choose optimal functions $c_k(t)$ to hold the
network in the optimal state. To define an optimal state we may:
1. Penalize underpressure and overpressure, and
2. Penalize fluxes that are too high.
(b) Make those functions $d_j(t)$ stochastic?

(c) (ML Goal) Train the AI to determine/estimate unknown gas draw $d_j(t)$
from a set of pressure/flux sensors $s_k(t)$ in the network. Assume that the 
compression functions $c_k(t)$ are known and so are the input nodes.
